# Simple Calculator
A *C# windows application* of a **simple calculator** .exe file to do your taxes :) (that's a joke don't use this to do your taxes unless you want to).
In the future I will be creating a more sophisticated calculator.\
So far it can only do addition, subtration, multiplaction and division.
